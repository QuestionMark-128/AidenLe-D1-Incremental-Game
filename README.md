# CMPM 121 D1 Project

This is the starting point for your CMPM 121 D1 project. The goal of this project is to create a simple web application using TypeScript, Vite, and modern web development practices. Students should make sure to remove _this_ content from their README.md file and replace it with their own project documentation.

I added a particle system refrenced from <https://github.com/Stan-21/cmpm-121-f25-d1> to spawn gems whenever the button is clicked. Stan's code did something that I really wanted to add if I had more time and I am really happy I saw someone do the same.
